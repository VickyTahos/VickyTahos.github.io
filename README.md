# Welcome!

My name is Vicky Tahos. I am a junior at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA. My major is Journalism and Communications and I am a double minor in Marketing and Sociology. I am interested in using my journalism and communication skills in combination with my sociology background to use that in the marketing field. I love to take pictures, especially for my own Instagram, playing and watching different sports, drinking coffee and playing with my dog.
